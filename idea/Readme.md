Stay healthy : Face Mask Detection : Caffe model is the pre-trained deep learning model used to detect faces.
For Face mask detection I have used pre-trained keras CNN model as shown in the article here.
OpencV is used to detect faces and CNN model to classify if mask is present or not .

Covid 19 , Cancer , Malaria detection :

Using openCV to detect images of disease and usage of CNN / Conv net model for disease prediction .
Steps for building Conv net :
Convolution Operation
ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)
Pooling Layer (Max Pooling)
Flattening
Fully Connected Layer

Mental Health : Usage of KNN , SVC , Logistic Regression , Decision tree , Random forest , Naive Bayes etc for prediction of Mental health .

Stree++ PCOS Predictor : KNN , Decision tree , Random Forest algorithms were explored . Usage of AutoML for selecting best algorithm.

Breast Cancer : Prediction of Breast cancer into malignant & Benign

Choice between Random forest , gaussian NB , KNN & Decision tree

Heart disease Models used for prediction:
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Tree
• Random Forest
• K Nearest Neighbour
• SVM

Usage of AutoML for selecting best algorithm

Website : Built with HTML , JS , Bootstrap , CSS3

Azure Health Bot with telegram as Channel : HelpHer

IDE used : visual Studio code Source code on : Github Stree++ & Stay Healthy : Deployed on Streamlit cloud Website Deployed using : Microsoft azure Health Bot : Azure Health Bot

Improvements to Be made : Integration of Flask backend
Integration of database to store user history
Usage of Azure ML Studio For making better models
Recommendation model for recommendation of appropriate doctors & Integration of Gpay and Gmaps for location of nearest clinic
