Pattern For building ML models :

Data Analysis<br>
Feature Engineering<br>
Satandardization<br>
Model Building<br>
Predictions<br>


Stay healthy :
Face Mask Detection :
Caffe model is the pre-trained deep learning model used to detect faces.<br>
For Face mask detection I have used pre-trained keras CNN model as shown in the article here.<br>
OpencV is used to detect faces and CNN model to classify if mask is present or not .<br>


Covid 19 , Cancer , Malaria detection :


Using openCV to detect images of disease and usage of CNN / Conv net model for disease 
prediction .<br>
Steps for building Conv net :<br> Convolution Operation<br>
ReLU Layer (Rectified Linear Unit)<br>
Pooling Layer (Max Pooling)<br>
Flattening<br>
Fully Connected Layer<br>


Mental Health :
Usage of KNN , SVC , Logistic Regression , Decision tree , Random forest , Naive Bayes etc for 
prediction of Mental health .


Stree++
PCOS Predictor :
KNN , Decision tree , Random Forest algorithms were explored .
Usage of AutoML for selecting best algorithm.

Breast Cancer :
Prediction of Breast cancer into malignant & Benign

Choice between Random forest , gaussian NB , KNN & Decision tree

Heart disease
Models used for prediction:<br>
• Logistic Regression<br>
• Decision Tree<br>
• Random Forest<br>
• K Nearest Neighbour<br>
• SVM<br>

Usage of AutoML for selecting best algorithm

Website : Built with HTML , JS , Bootstrap , CSS3
